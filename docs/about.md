# About
So, I am Just A Guy that is a big believer in the Linux community. I am NO expert. I am a user. I do work in the tech industry but not as a tech expert.

The question is why would someone who is not a network engineer, not a coder and generally unqualified start a channel about different Linux distros, installation and reviews.

I think there are people like me that just donâ€™t know where to start or have the confidence to try something new. After all, people complain about how there system crashes but very few will try something completely different.

A few years ago, I was tired of the slow responsiveness of my PC and the 3 crashes per day when I decided to try Linux Mint.

Holy crap!! It was like having a new PC. Very quick. Very snappy and devoid of crashes.

If I can switch, you can too. Try it. You might like it.

Thanks for stopping by.
