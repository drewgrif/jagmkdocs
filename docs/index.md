# JustAGuyLinux Library

**Your Slightly Eccentric Hub for Thoughts, Documentation, and YouTube Video Notes**

Welcome to JustAGuyLinux, where our motto is “Not an expert. Just A Guy." I try my best but am not always successful. If you’ve ever found yourself lost in the labyrinth of Linux documentation or scratching your head over YouTube video summaries, you’re in good company.

## What We Offer

### **Thoughts & Insights**
A collection of musings, reflections, and occasional rants about Linux and open-source software is here to entertain and inform. I definitely don't have all the answers (hence the name ... Just A Guy), but I promise to give her a shot.

### **Comprehensive Documentation**
Ever wish you had a guide that explains Linux without making you feel like you need a PhD in computer science? Look no further! I seriously don't have a clue ... most of the time. My goal is to provide documentation that’s clear, helpful, and occasionally useful.

### **YouTube Video Notes**
Struggling to remember what you watched on that 30-minute video? (Me too) I am making an effort to offer a concise summary so you don’t have to replay the entire thing. Working on making this a regular commitment.

## Why Choose Us?

- **Expertise**: I like to think of myself as "just some random" that loves to tinker. Eternally learning right alongside you!
- **Clarity**: My goal is to explain things in a simple way so that even someone without a technical background, like me, can understand and explain them easily.
- **Community**: Join a group of fellow enthusiasts who, like you, are figuring this out as they go. At least we’re all in this together!
- **Podcast**: Currently, I am a regular on [The Linux Cast](https://thelinuxcast.org){:target="_blank"} podcast.  Sometimes I hang on [The Linux Cast Discord server](https://discord.gg/C9je3KSrFA){:target="_blank"}.
