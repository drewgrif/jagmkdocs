# JustAGuyLinux Library

Welcome to JustAGuyLinux, where the motto is “Not an expert. Just A Guy." I try my best but am not always successful. If you’ve ever found yourself lost in the labyrinth of Linux documentation or scratching your head over YouTube video summaries, you’re not alone.

## Why JustAGuy Linux?

- **Expertise**: I like to think of myself as "just some random" that loves to tinker. Eternally learning right alongside you!
- **Clarity**: My goal is to explain things in a simple way so that even someone without a technical background, like me, can understand and explain them easily.
- **Podcast**: Currently, I am a regular on [The Linux Cast](https://thelinuxcast.org){:target="_blank"} podcast.  Sometimes I hang on [The Linux Cast Discord server](https://discord.gg/C9je3KSrFA){:target="_blank"}.

### **Documentation**
Ever wish you had a guide that explains Linux without making you feel like you need a PhD in computer science? Look no further! I seriously don't have a clue ... most of the time. My goal is to provide documentation that’s clear, helpful, and occasionally useful.

### **YouTube Video Notes**
Struggling to remember what you watched on that 30-minute video? (Me too) I am making an effort to offer a concise summary so you don’t have to replay the entire thing. Working on making this a regular commitment.
