There are several arguments people make for reducing or eliminating reliance on Google, including:

1. **Privacy Concerns**: Google collects vast amounts of user data, raising concerns about privacy and surveillance.

2. **Monopoly Power**: Critics argue that Google’s dominance in search and advertising stifles competition and innovation.

3. **Content Control**: Google's algorithms can influence what information is seen, potentially limiting access to diverse viewpoints.

4. **Data Security**: High-profile data breaches and concerns about data handling practices can make users wary.

5. **Dependency**: Over-reliance on Google services can hinder the development of alternative platforms and services.

6. **Manipulation of Information**: There are fears about bias in search results and potential manipulation of information for political or commercial gain.

7. **Environmental Impact**: The data centers that power Google services consume significant energy, contributing to environmental concerns.

8. **User Experience**: Some users feel overwhelmed by ads and irrelevant search results, leading to a poor user experience.

9. **Mental Health**: Constant exposure to information and notifications can lead to anxiety and information overload.

10. **Cultural Homogenization**: The dominance of Google can lead to a narrowing of cultural diversity in online content.

These points encourage discussions about digital autonomy, competition, and the ethical implications of tech giants.
