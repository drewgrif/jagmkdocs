**Whoogle** is a privacy-focused search engine that provides results from Google without tracking users. Its main goal is to offer a way to search the web while keeping your searches private.

Here’s how it works:

- **Search Queries:** When you enter a search query into Whoogle, it sends your query to Google’s search engine.
- **Fetching Results:** Google returns the search results to Whoogle.
- **Privacy Protection:** Whoogle then removes any identifying information from these results before displaying them to you. This way, Google doesn’t get any information about who made the search, preserving your privacy.
- **Presentation:** Whoogle presents the results to you in a user-friendly format, similar to Google’s, but without the tracking.
- By acting as an intermediary between you and Google, Whoogle allows you to use Google’s powerful search capabilities while avoiding Google’s tracking and data collection practices.
